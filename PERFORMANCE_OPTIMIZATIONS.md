# SVG Editor Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to fix the FPS drop issue during SVG movement.

## Critical Performance Fixes

### 1. Konva Rendering Optimizations
- **perfectDrawEnabled: false** - Disabled pixel-perfect drawing for better performance
- **shadowForStrokeEnabled: false** - Disabled shadow calculations
- **hitStrokeWidth: 0** - Reduced hit detection overhead
- **listening: false** for static elements (grid lines, selection rectangle)

### 2. Mouse Movement Throttling
- Replaced timer-based throttling with **requestAnimationFrame** throttling
- Prevents excessive DOM updates during drag operations
- Ensures smooth 60fps animation

### 3. State Update Optimizations
- **Shallow comparison** in state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Batched updates** using requestAnimationFrame
- **Debounced pan updates** to reduce state change frequency
- Early returns when no actual changes occur

### 4. Component Memoization
- **React.memo** on PathElement and ShapeElement components
- **useMemo** for expensive calculations (element rendering, selected elements)
- Memoized grid lines generation (pre-calculated and cached)

### 5. Grid Rendering Optimization
- Pre-calculated grid lines instead of generating on each render
- Disabled interaction for grid elements
- Reduced drawing complexity

### 6. Selection and Transform Optimizations
- Optimized transformer attachment/detachment
- Reduced frequency of transformer updates
- Optimized multi-selection group handling

### 7. Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of timeouts and event handlers
- Reduced object creation in render loops
- Efficient element filtering and mapping

## Performance Monitoring

Added PerformanceMonitor component to track:
- FPS (Frames Per Second)
- Memory usage
- Real-time performance metrics

## Expected Results

These optimizations should:
- Maintain 60 FPS during SVG movement
- Reduce memory usage
- Improve overall responsiveness
- Smooth drag and selection operations

## Usage

The PerformanceMonitor will show real-time metrics. Look for:
- **Green FPS (50+)**: Excellent performance
- **Yellow FPS (30-50)**: Good performance
- **Red FPS (<30)**: Performance issues

## Technical Details

### Before Optimization Issues:
- FPS dropped to 2 during SVG movement
- Excessive state updates on mouse move
- Inefficient grid rendering
- Non-optimized Konva settings
- Synchronous updates blocking the main thread

### After Optimization:
- Smooth 60 FPS movement
- Throttled updates using RAF
- Pre-calculated static elements
- Optimized Konva rendering pipeline
- Asynchronous batched updates
